// Developer Express Code Central Example:
// How to completely hide the dock panel's caption?
// 
// By setting the DockManager.DockingOptions.ShowCaptionOnMouseHover property it's
// possible to set whether the dock panel's caption is shown only when the mouse
// pointer hovers over the panel's top or all the time. This example demonstrates
// how to prevent the dock panel's caption from being shown for an individual dock
// panel all the time.
